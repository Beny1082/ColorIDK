          <p>Our purpose as a website is to provide awareness to keep our environment safe and clean. In a world where
            there is global warming, animals going into extinction, and air pollution destroying our ozone, it is almost too late
            to save our Earth and environment. So we must act now and take the right precautions to literally save our planet. If we 
            want to live even as long as Dinasours did(around 240 million years) then it is necessary to teach people about the environment on 
            earth and how to keep it clean.
